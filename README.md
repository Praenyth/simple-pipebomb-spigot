## Simple Pipebomb (Spigot)

# Pipebombs? We love 'em!

Introducting the silly little technique called naming a bunch of tnt "pipebomb" and placing it in a chest (or any storage container) and *let it rip*. Pipebomb damage stacks up too! Add a whole chest inventory worth of them inside and watch everyone within a 20 block radius *dissapear*... disaper... disappear...? Well, they just die on the spot right there. Not cursed at all whatsoever!
